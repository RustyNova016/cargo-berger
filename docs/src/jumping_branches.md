# Jumping branches

While it is nice to follow through on a branch all the way to a pull request, sometimes you do need to switch to another branch. Cargo Berger allows for helpful quick switching of branches for making transitions as smooth as butter.

## `new-feat`

This command does a save commit on the current branch, and create a new feature branch from the default branch, ready for work.

Note: While it is called "new feature", it's still valid for any kind of changes

## `quick-switch`

Does a save commit on the current branch, then switch to another.
