# Release the kraken (code)

Once you're ready to release, you can streamline the workflow using the `release` command. This will:

- Create a new feature branch
- Apply some prerelease hooks
- Create (and check) a full commit
- Add a version tag to the commit
- Run post release hooks

You can then create a pr or merge it yourself.
