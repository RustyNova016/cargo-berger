# Git the changes

Creating branches and switching is pretty nice, but you may also want to get latest changes of your branches

# `pull`

`git fetch`, `git pull`. That's it.

# `rebase-default`

Does a `git rebase origin/master`, bringing the latest changes of `master` into the branch. This does a save commit right before so the tree can be dirty.
